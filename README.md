Hey there fellas, here is my stab at the proper way of using GitHub.

I am trying to make some changes to this branch and merge it back to Master. This is getting cool.
I hope to learn more. I am also trying to learn the DevOps process. I hope to make it in this career.
Keep up the good work fellas.

Respectfully,
Dpak
